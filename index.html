          <p>RuPaul Andre Charles (born November 17, 1960) is an American drag queen, television personality, actor,
            singer, and producer. He produces, hosts, and judges the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race and
            has received several accolades, including 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, three GLAAD Media Awards, a Critics'
            Choice Television Award, two Billboard Music Awards, and a Tony Award. He has been dubbed the "Queen of
            Drag" and is considered the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States, with Fortune
            saying that he is "easily the world's most famous drag queen."</p>

          <p>Born and raised in San Diego, RuPaul later studied performing arts in Atlanta, before relocating to New
            York City, where he became a popular fixture on the LGBT nightclub scene. He achieved international fame as
            a drag queen with the release of his debut single, "Supermodel (You Better Work)", which was included on his
            debut studio album Supermodel of the World (1993). RuPaul became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics in 1994,
            raising money for the Mac AIDS Fund and becoming the first drag queen to land a major cosmetics campaign. He
            later received his own television talk show on VH1 titled The RuPaul Show (1996&ndash;1998), while
            co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage.</p>

          <p>RuPaul's Drag Race was created in 2009 and has gone on to produce fifteen seasons in the United States. The
            show has also seen success internationally. There are several international variants of the show, including
            RuPaul's Drag Race UK (2019&ndash;present) and Canada's Drag Race (2020&ndash;present). This has also
            inspired several spin-offs of the main show, including RuPaul's Drag U (2010&ndash;2012), RuPaul's Drag Race
            All Stars, (2012&ndash;present), and RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race (2020&ndash;2022). He has also
            featured as a host on other reality series, such as Skin Wars (2014&ndash;2016), Good Work (2015), and Gay
            for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul (2016&ndash;2017).</p>

          <p>RuPaul has made appearances in films, including Crooklyn (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), To Wong Foo,
            Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), and But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), as well as television series,
            including Girlboss (2017), Broad City (2017), and Grace and Frankie (2019). He created and starred in his
            own Netflix original series AJ and the Queen (2020). RuPaul has also published three books: Lettin' It All
            Hang Out (1995), Workin' It! RuPaul's Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style (2010) and GuRu

            Musical as a producer for the musical A Strange Loop (2019).</p>
